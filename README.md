# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


When applying to EEG my startup pitch was for an app centered around nightlife that connected users through events, images, and rating establishments. It also served as a safety tool for bouncers to track incidents in large venues so response times would improve. Essentially, the app would allow all users to have a profile and before they embark on their night other users can link their profiles together, forming groups. At the establishment, they scan the QR code of the establishment and if there is an incident the bouncers and their "group" would be alerted. On the app they can also rate the club, post aesthetic photos, and connect with promoters.

In order to validate my idea I created a landing page that allowed users to enter their names and email addresses if interested in the product. During pre-product, this landing page would be sent out to gain traction and see if people would be interested in the product. The landing page is purple, because this is the color of the app I envisioned in my original pitch. It is a simple design with a photo of a nightclub and a form for users to enter their information. The short text succinctly describes the product to inform potential customers.

This landing page validates the assumption that users see the usefulness of the app "Elixir" before it is built or launched. This is critical because it indicates if I should pivot the product or continue with the idea. I can see this website being sent out using an Instagram page for the app. It would be a story post where people can swipe up to "Join Waitlist".
